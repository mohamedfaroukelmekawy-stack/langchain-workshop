# LangChain Workshop Project 🦜🔗

This repository is a **personal learning project** where I explored and implemented
core concepts of LangChain and LLM-based applications through hands-on notebooks.

The project covers prompt engineering, chains, structured outputs, and agent-based workflows,
with practical examples and experiments.
